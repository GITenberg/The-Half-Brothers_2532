<h1>THE HALF-BROTHERS<br />
by Elizabeth Gaskell</h1>
<p>My mother was twice married.&nbsp; She never spoke of her first husband,
and it is only from other people that I have learnt what little I know
about him.&nbsp; I believe she was scarcely seventeen when she was married
to him: and he was barely one-and-twenty.&nbsp; He rented a small farm
up in Cumberland, somewhere towards the sea-coast; but he was perhaps
too young and inexperienced to have the charge of land and cattle: anyhow,
his affairs did not prosper, and he fell into ill health, and died of
consumption before they had been three years man and wife, leaving my
mother a young widow of twenty, with a little child only just able to
walk, and the farm on her hands for four years more by the lease, with
half the stock on it dead, or sold off one by one to pay the more pressing
debts, and with no money to purchase more, or even to buy the provisions
needed for the small consumption of every day.&nbsp; There was another
child coming, too; and sad and sorry, I believe, she was to think of
it.&nbsp; A dreary winter she must have had in her lonesome dwelling,
with never another near it for miles around; her sister came to bear
her company, and they two planned and plotted how to make every penny
they could raise go as far as possible.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t tell you
how it happened that my little sister, whom I never saw, came to sicken
and die; but, as if my poor mother&rsquo;s cup was not full enough,
only a fortnight before Gregory was born the little girl took ill of
scarlet fever, and in a week she lay dead.&nbsp; My mother was, I believe,
just stunned with this last blow.&nbsp; My aunt has told me that she
did not cry; aunt Fanny would have been thankful if she had; but she
sat holding the poor wee lassie&rsquo;s hand and looking in her pretty,
pale, dead face, without so much as shedding a tear.&nbsp; And it was
all the same, when they had to take her away to be buried.&nbsp; She
just kissed the child, and sat her down in the window-seat to watch
the little black train of people (neighbours&mdash;my aunt, and one
far-off cousin, who were all the friends they could muster) go winding
away amongst the snow, which had fallen thinly over the country the
night before.&nbsp; When my aunt came back from the funeral, she found
my mother in the same place, and as dry-eyed as ever.&nbsp; So she continued
until after Gregory was born; and, somehow, his coming seemed to loosen
the tears, and she cried day and night, till my aunt and the other watcher
looked at each other in dismay, and would fain have stopped her if they
had but known how.&nbsp; But she bade them let her alone, and not be
over-anxious, for every drop she shed eased her brain, which had been
in a terrible state before for want of the power to cry.&nbsp; She seemed
after that to think of nothing but her new little baby; she had hardly
appeared to remember either her husband or her little daughter that
lay dead in Brigham churchyard&mdash;at least so aunt Fanny said, but
she was a great talker, and my mother was very silent by nature, and
I think aunt Fanny may have been mistaken in believing that my mother
never thought of her husband and child just because she never spoke
about them.&nbsp; Aunt Fanny was older than my mother, and had a way
of treating her like a child; but, for all that, she was a kind, warm-hearted
creature, who thought more of her sister&rsquo;s welfare than she did
of her own and it was on her bit of money that they principally lived,
and on what the two could earn by working for the great Glasgow sewing-merchants.&nbsp;
But by-and-by my mother&rsquo;s eye-sight began to fail.&nbsp; It was
not that she was exactly blind, for she could see well enough to guide
herself about the house, and to do a good deal of domestic work; but
she could no longer do fine sewing and earn money.&nbsp; It must have
been with the heavy crying she had had in her day, for she was but a
young creature at this time, and as pretty a young woman, I have heard
people say, as any on the country side.&nbsp; She took it sadly to heart
that she could no longer gain anything towards the keep of herself and
her child.&nbsp; My aunt Fanny would fain have persuaded her that she
had enough to do in managing their cottage and minding Gregory; but
my mother knew that they were pinched, and that aunt Fanny herself had
not as much to eat, even of the commonest kind of food, as she could
have done with; and as for Gregory, he was not a strong lad, and needed,
not more food&mdash;for he always had enough, whoever went short&mdash;but
better nourishment, and more flesh-meat.&nbsp; One day&mdash;it was
aunt Fanny who told me all this about my poor mother, long after her
death&mdash;as the sisters were sitting together, aunt Fanny working,
and my mother hushing Gregory to sleep, William Preston, who was afterwards
my father, came in.&nbsp; He was reckoned an old bachelor; I suppose
he was long past forty, and he was one of the wealthiest farmers thereabouts,
and had known my grandfather well, and my mother and my aunt in their
more prosperous days.&nbsp; He sat down, and began to twirl his hat
by way of being agreeable; my aunt Fanny talked, and he listened and
looked at my mother.&nbsp; But he said very little, either on that visit,
or on many another that he paid before he spoke out what had been the
real purpose of his calling so often all along, and from the very first
time he came to their house.&nbsp; One Sunday, however, my aunt Fanny
stayed away from church, and took care of the child, and my mother went
alone.&nbsp; When she came back, she ran straight upstairs, without
going into the kitchen to look at Gregory or speak any word to her sister,
and aunt Fanny heard her cry as if her heart was breaking; so she went
up and scolded her right well through the bolted door, till at last
she got her to open it.&nbsp; And then she threw herself on my aunt&rsquo;s
neck, and told her that William Preston had asked her to marry him,
and had promised to take good charge of her boy, and to let him want
for nothing, neither in the way of keep nor of education, and that she
had consented.&nbsp; Aunt Fanny was a good deal shocked at this; for,
as I have said, she had often thought that my mother had forgotten her
first husband very quickly, and now here was proof positive of it, if
she could so soon think of marrying again.&nbsp; Besides as aunt Fanny
used to say, she herself would have been a far more suitable match for
a man of William Preston&rsquo;s age than Helen, who, though she was
a widow, had not seen her four-and-twentieth summer.&nbsp; However,
as aunt Fanny said, they had not asked her advice; and there was much
to be said on the other side of the question.&nbsp; Helen&rsquo;s eyesight
would never be good for much again, and as William Preston&rsquo;s wife
she would never need to do anything, if she chose to sit with her hands
before her; and a boy was a great charge to a widowed mother; and now
there would be a decent steady man to see after him.&nbsp; So, by-and-by,
aunt Fanny seemed to take a brighter view of the marriage than did my
mother herself, who hardly ever looked up, and never smiled after the
day when she promised William Preston to be his wife.&nbsp; But much
as she had loved Gregory before, she seemed to love him more now.&nbsp;
She was continually talking to him when they were alone, though he was
far too young to understand her moaning words, or give her any comfort,
except by his caresses.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At last William Preston and she were wed; and she went to be mistress
of a well-stocked house, not above half-an-hour&rsquo;s walk from where
aunt Fanny lived.&nbsp; I believe she did all that she could to please
my father; and a more dutiful wife, I have heard him himself say, could
never have been.&nbsp; But she did not love him, and he soon found it
out.&nbsp; She loved Gregory, and she did not love him.&nbsp; Perhaps,
love would have come in time, if he had been patient enough to wait;
but it just turned him sour to see how her eye brightened and her colour
came at the sight of that little child, while for him who had given
her so much, she had only gentle words as cold as ice.&nbsp; He got
to taunt her with the difference in her manner, as if that would bring
love: and he took a positive dislike to Gregory,&mdash;he was so jealous
of the ready love that always gushed out like a spring of fresh water
when he came near.&nbsp; He wanted her to love him more, and perhaps
that was all well and good; but he wanted her to love her child less,
and that was an evil wish.&nbsp; One day, he gave way to his temper,
and cursed and swore at Gregory, who had got into some mischief, as
children will; my mother made some excuse for him; my father said it
was hard enough to have to keep another man&rsquo;s child, without having
it perpetually held up in its naughtiness by his wife, who ought to
be always in the same mind that he was; and so from little they got
to more; and the end of it was, that my mother took to her bed before
her time, and I was born that very day.&nbsp; My father was glad, and
proud, and sorry, all in a breath; glad and proud that a son was born
to him; and sorry for his poor wife&rsquo;s state, and to think how
his angry words had brought it on.&nbsp; But he was a man who liked
better to be angry than sorry, so he soon found out that it was all
Gregory&rsquo;s fault, and owed him an additional grudge for having
hastened my birth.&nbsp; He had another grudge against him before long.&nbsp;
My mother began to sink the day after I was born.&nbsp; My father sent
to Carlisle for doctors, and would have coined his heart&rsquo;s blood
into gold to save her, if that could have been; but it could not.&nbsp;
My aunt Fanny used to say sometimes, that she thought that Helen did
not wish to live, and so just let herself die away without trying to
take hold on life; but when I questioned her, she owned that my mother
did all the doctors bade her do, with the same sort of uncomplaining
patience with which she had acted through life.&nbsp; One of her last
requests was to have Gregory laid in her bed by my side, and then she
made him take hold of my little hand.&nbsp; Her husband came in while
she was looking at us so, and when he bent tenderly over her to ask
her how she felt now, and seemed to gaze on us two little half-brothers,
with a grave sort of kindness, she looked up in his face and smiled,
almost her first smile at him; and such a sweet smile! as more besides
aunt Fanny have said.&nbsp; In an hour she was dead.&nbsp; Aunt Fanny
came to live with us.&nbsp; It was the best thing that could be done.&nbsp;
My father would have been glad to return to his old mode of bachelor
life, but what could he do with two little children?&nbsp; He needed
a woman to take care of him, and who so fitting as his wife&rsquo;s
elder sister?&nbsp; So she had the charge of me from my birth; and for
a time I was weakly, as was but natural, and she was always beside me,
night and day watching over me, and my father nearly as anxious as she.&nbsp;
For his land had come down from father to son for more than three hundred
years, and he would have cared for me merely as his flesh and blood
that was to inherit the land after him.&nbsp; But he needed something
to love, for all that, to most people, he was a stern, hard man, and
he took to me as, I fancy, he had taken to no human being before&mdash;as
he might have taken to my mother, if she had had no former life for
him to be jealous of.&nbsp; I loved him back again right heartily.&nbsp;
I loved all around me, I believe, for everybody was kind to me.&nbsp;
After a time, I overcame my original weakness of constitution, and was
just a bonny, strong-looking lad whom every passer-by noticed, when
my father took me with him to the nearest town.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At home I was the darling of my aunt, the tenderly-beloved of my
father, the pet and plaything of the old domestics, the &ldquo;young
master&rdquo; of the farm-labourers, before whom I played many a lordly
antic, assuming a sort of authority which sat oddly enough, I doubt
not, on such a baby as I was.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gregory was three years older than I.&nbsp; Aunt Fanny was always
kind to him in deed and in action, but she did not often think about
him, she had fallen so completely into the habit of being engrossed
by me, from the fact of my having come into her charge as a delicate
baby.&nbsp; My father never got over his grudging dislike to his stepson,
who had so innocently wrestled with him for the possession of my mother&rsquo;s
heart.&nbsp; I mistrust me, too, that my father always considered him
as the cause of my mother&rsquo;s death and my early delicacy; and utterly
unreasonable as this may seem, I believe my father rather cherished
his feeling of alienation to my brother as a duty, than strove to repress
it.&nbsp; Yet not for the world would my father have grudged him anything
that money could purchase.&nbsp; That was, as it were, in the bond when
he had wedded my mother.&nbsp; Gregory was lumpish and loutish, awkward
and ungainly, marring whatever he meddled in, and many a hard word and
sharp scolding did he get from the people about the farm, who hardly
waited till my father&rsquo;s back was turned before they rated the
stepson.&nbsp; I am ashamed&mdash;my heart is sore to think how I fell
into the fashion of the family, and slighted my poor orphan step-brother.&nbsp;
I don&rsquo;t think I ever scouted him, or was wilfully ill-natured
to him; but the habit of being considered in all things, and being treated
as something uncommon and superior, made me insolent in my prosperity,
and I exacted more than Gregory was always willing to grant, and then,
irritated, I sometimes repeated the disparaging words I had heard others
use with regard to him, without fully understanding their meaning.&nbsp;
Whether he did or not I cannot tell.&nbsp; I am afraid he did.&nbsp;
He used to turn silent and quiet&mdash;sullen and sulky, my father thought
it: stupid, aunt Fanny used to call it.&nbsp; But every one said he
was stupid and dull, and this stupidity and dullness grew upon him.&nbsp;
He would sit without speaking a word, sometimes, for hours; then my
father would bid him rise and do some piece of work, maybe, about the
farm.&nbsp; And he would take three or four tellings before he would
go.&nbsp; When we were sent to school, it was all the same.&nbsp; He
could never be made to remember his lessons; the school-master grew
weary of scolding and flogging, and at last advised my father just to
take him away, and set him to some farm-work that might not be above
his comprehension.&nbsp; I think he was more gloomy and stupid than
ever after this, yet he was not a cross lad; he was patient and good-natured,
and would try to do a kind turn for any one, even if they had been scolding
or cuffing him not a minute before.&nbsp; But very often his attempts
at kindness ended in some mischief to the very people he was trying
to serve, owing to his awkward, ungainly ways.&nbsp; I suppose I was
a clever lad; at any rate, I always got plenty of praise; and was, as
we called it, the cock of the school.&nbsp; The schoolmaster said I
could learn anything I chose, but my father, who had no great learning
himself, saw little use in much for me, and took me away betimes, and
kept me with him about the farm.&nbsp; Gregory was made into a kind
of shepherd, receiving his training under old Adam, who was nearly past
his work.&nbsp; I think old Adam was almost the first person who had
a good opinion of Gregory.&nbsp; He stood to it that my brother had
good parts, though he did not rightly know how to bring them out; and,
for knowing the bearings of the Fells, he said he had never seen a lad
like him.&nbsp; My father would try to bring Adam round to speak of
Gregory&rsquo;s faults and shortcomings; but, instead of that, he would
praise him twice as much, as soon as he found out what was my father&rsquo;s
object.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One winter-time, when I was about sixteen, and Gregory nineteen,
I was sent by my father on an errand to a place about seven miles distant
by the road, but only about four by the Fells.&nbsp; He bade me return
by the road, whichever way I took in going, for the evenings closed
in early, and were often thick and misty; besides which, old Adam, now
paralytic and bedridden, foretold a downfall of snow before long.&nbsp;
I soon got to my journey&rsquo;s end, and soon had done my business;
earlier by an hour, I thought, than my father had expected, so I took
the decision of the way by which I would return into my own hands, and
set off back again over the Fells, just as the first shades of evening
began to fall.&nbsp; It looked dark and gloomy enough; but everything
was so still that I thought I should have plenty of time to get home
before the snow came down.&nbsp; Off I set at a pretty quick pace.&nbsp;
But night came on quicker.&nbsp; The right path was clear enough in
the day-time, although at several points two or three exactly similar
diverged from the same place; but when there was a good light, the traveller
was guided by the sight of distant objects,&mdash;a piece of rock,&mdash;a
fall in the ground&mdash;which were quite invisible to me now.&nbsp;
I plucked up a brave heart, however, and took what seemed to me the
right road.&nbsp; It was wrong, nevertheless, and led me whither I knew
not, but to some wild boggy moor where the solitude seemed painful,
intense, as if never footfall of man had come thither to break the silence.&nbsp;
I tried to shout&mdash;with the dimmest possible hope of being heard&mdash;rather
to reassure myself by the sound of my own voice; but my voice came husky
and short, and yet it dismayed me; it seemed so weird and strange, in
that noiseless expanse of black darkness.&nbsp; Suddenly the air was
filled thick with dusky flakes, my face and hands were wet with snow.&nbsp;
It cut me off from the slightest knowledge of where I was, for I lost
every idea of the direction from which I had come, so that I could not
even retrace my steps; it hemmed me in, thicker, thicker, with a darkness
that might be felt.&nbsp; The boggy soil on which I stood quaked under
me if I remained long in one place, and yet I dared not move far.&nbsp;
All my youthful hardiness seemed to leave me at once.&nbsp; I was on
the point of crying, and only very shame seemed to keep it down.&nbsp;
To save myself from shedding tears, I shouted&mdash;terrible, wild shouts
for bare life they were.&nbsp; I turned sick as I paused to listen;
no answering sound came but the unfeeling echoes.&nbsp; Only the noiseless,
pitiless snow kept falling thicker, thicker&mdash;faster, faster!&nbsp;
I was growing numb and sleepy.&nbsp; I tried to move about, but I dared
not go far, for fear of the precipices which, I knew, abounded in certain
places on the Fells.&nbsp; Now and then, I stood still and shouted again;
but my voice was getting choked with tears, as I thought of the desolate
helpless death I was to die, and how little they at home, sitting round
the warm, red, bright fire, wotted what was become of me,&mdash;and
how my poor father would grieve for me&mdash;it would surely kill him&mdash;it
would break his heart, poor old man!&nbsp; Aunt Fanny too&mdash;was
this to be the end of all her cares for me?&nbsp; I began to review
my life in a strange kind of vivid dream, in which the various scenes
of my few boyish years passed before me like visions.&nbsp; In a pang
of agony, caused by such remembrance of my short life, I gathered up
my strength and called out once more, a long, despairing, wailing cry,
to which I had no hope of obtaining any answer, save from the echoes
around, dulled as the sound might be by the thickened air.&nbsp; To
my surprise I heard a cry&mdash;almost as long, as wild as mine&mdash;so
wild that it seemed unearthly, and I almost thought it must be the voice
of some of the mocking spirits of the Fells, about whom I had heard
so many tales.&nbsp; My heart suddenly began to beat fast and loud.&nbsp;
I could not reply for a minute or two.&nbsp; I nearly fancied I had
lost the power of utterance.&nbsp; Just at this moment a dog barked.&nbsp;
Was it Lassie&rsquo;s bark&mdash;my brother&rsquo;s collie?&mdash;an
ugly enough brute, with a white, ill-looking face, that my father always
kicked whenever he saw it, partly for its own demerits, partly because
it belonged to my brother.&nbsp; On such occasions, Gregory would whistle
Lassie away, and go off and sit with her in some outhouse.&nbsp; My
father had once or twice been ashamed of himself, when the poor collie
had yowled out with the suddenness of the pain, and had relieved himself
of his self-reproach by blaming my brother, who, he said, had no notion
of training a dog, and was enough to ruin any collie in Christendom
with his stupid way of allowing them to lie by the kitchen fire.&nbsp;
To all which Gregory would answer nothing, nor even seem to hear, but
go on looking absent and moody.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes! there again!&nbsp; It was Lassie&rsquo;s bark!&nbsp; Now or
never!&nbsp; I lifted up my voice and shouted &ldquo;Lassie! Lassie!
for God&rsquo;s sake, Lassie!&rdquo; Another moment, and the great white-faced
Lassie was curving and gambolling with delight round my feet and legs,
looking, however, up in my face with her intelligent, apprehensive eyes,
as if fearing lest I might greet her with a blow, as I had done oftentimes
before.&nbsp; But I cried with gladness, as I stooped down and patted
her.&nbsp; My mind was sharing in my body&rsquo;s weakness, and I could
not reason, but I knew that help was at hand.&nbsp; A gray figure came
more and more distinctly out of the thick, close-pressing darkness.&nbsp;
It was Gregory wrapped in his maud.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Gregory!&rdquo; said I, and I fell upon his neck, unable
to speak another word.&nbsp; He never spoke much, and made me no answer
for some little time.&nbsp; Then he told me we must move, we must walk
for the dear life&mdash;we must find our road home, if possible; but
we must move, or we should be frozen to death.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know the way home?&rdquo; asked I.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought I did when I set out, but I am doubtful now.&nbsp;
The snow blinds me, and I am feared that in moving about just now, I
have lost the right gait homewards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He had his shepherd&rsquo;s staff with him, and by dint of plunging
it before us at every step we took&mdash;clinging close to each other,
we went on safely enough, as far as not falling down any of the steep
rocks, but it was slow, dreary work.&nbsp; My brother, I saw, was more
guided by Lassie and the way she took than anything else, trusting to
her instinct.&nbsp; It was too dark to see far before us; but he called
her back continually, and noted from what quarter she returned, and
shaped our slow steps accordingly.&nbsp; But the tedious motion scarcely
kept my very blood from freezing.&nbsp; Every bone, every fibre in my
body seemed first to ache, and then to swell, and then to turn numb
with the intense cold.&nbsp; My brother bore it better than I, from
having been more out upon the hills.&nbsp; He did not speak, except
to call Lassie.&nbsp; I strove to be brave, and not complain; but now
I felt the deadly fatal sleep stealing over me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can go no farther,&rdquo; I said, in a drowsy tone.&nbsp;
I remember I suddenly became dogged and resolved.&nbsp; Sleep I would,
were it only for five minutes.&nbsp; If death were to be the consequence,
sleep I would.&nbsp; Gregory stood still.&nbsp; I suppose, he recognized
the peculiar phase of suffering to which I had been brought by the cold.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is of no use,&rdquo; said he, as if to himself.&nbsp; &ldquo;We
are no nearer home than we were when we started, as far as I can tell.&nbsp;
Our only chance is in Lassie.&nbsp; Here! roll thee in my maud, lad,
and lay thee down on this sheltered side of this bit of rock.&nbsp;
Creep close under it, lad, and I&rsquo;ll lie by thee, and strive to
keep the warmth in us.&nbsp; Stay! hast gotten aught about thee they&rsquo;ll
know at home?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I felt him unkind thus to keep me from slumber, but on his repeating
the question, I pulled out my pocket-handkerchief, of some showy pattern,
which Aunt Fanny had hemmed for me&mdash;Gregory took it, and tied it
round Lassie&rsquo;s neck.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hie thee, Lassie, hie thee home!&rdquo;&nbsp; And the white-faced
ill-favoured brute was off like a shot in the darkness.&nbsp; Now I
might lie down&mdash;now I might sleep.&nbsp; In my drowsy stupor I
felt that I was being tenderly covered up by my brother; but what with
I neither knew nor cared&mdash;I was too dull, too selfish, too numb
to think and reason, or I might have known that in that bleak bare place
there was nought to wrap me in, save what was taken off another.&nbsp;
I was glad enough when he ceased his cares and lay down by me.&nbsp;
I took his hand.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou canst not remember, lad, how we lay together thus by
our dying mother.&nbsp; She put thy small, wee hand in mine&mdash;I
reckon she sees us now; and belike we shall soon be with her.&nbsp;
Anyhow, God&rsquo;s will be done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear Gregory,&rdquo; I muttered, and crept nearer to him for
warmth.&nbsp; He was talking still, and again about our mother, when
I fell asleep.&nbsp; In an instant&mdash;or so it seemed&mdash;there
were many voices about me&mdash;many faces hovering round me&mdash;the
sweet luxury of warmth was stealing into every part of me.&nbsp; I was
in my own little bed at home.&nbsp; I am thankful to say, my first word
was &ldquo;Gregory?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A look passed from one to another&mdash;my father&rsquo;s stern old
face strove in vain to keep its sternness; his mouth quivered, his eyes
filled slowly with unwonted tears.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would have given him half my land&mdash;I would have blessed
him as my son,&mdash;oh God!&nbsp; I would have knelt at his feet, and
asked him to forgive my hardness of heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I heard no more.&nbsp; A whirl came through my brain, catching me
back to death.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I came slowly to my consciousness, weeks afterwards.&nbsp; My father&rsquo;s
hair was white when I recovered, and his hands shook as he looked into
my face.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We spoke no more of Gregory.&nbsp; We could not speak of him; but
he was strangely in our thoughts.&nbsp; Lassie came and went with never
a word of blame; nay, my father would try to stroke her, but she shrank
away; and he, as if reproved by the poor dumb beast, would sigh, and
be silent and abstracted for a time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Aunt Fanny&mdash;always a talker&mdash;told me all.&nbsp; How, on
that fatal night, my father,&mdash;irritated by my prolonged absence,
and probably more anxious than he cared to show, had been fierce and
imperious, even beyond his wont, to Gregory; had upbraided him with
his father&rsquo;s poverty, his own stupidity which made his services
good for nothing&mdash;for so, in spite of the old shepherd, my father
always chose to consider them.&nbsp; At last, Gregory had risen up,
and whistled Lassie out with him&mdash;poor Lassie, crouching underneath
his chair for fear of a kick or a blow.&nbsp; Some time before, there
had been some talk between my father and my aunt respecting my return;
and when aunt Fanny told me all this, she said she fancied that Gregory
might have noticed the coming storm, and gone out silently to meet me.&nbsp;
Three hours afterwards, when all were running about in wild alarm, not
knowing whither to go in search of me&mdash;not even missing Gregory,
or heeding his absence, poor fellow&mdash;poor, poor fellow!&mdash;Lassie
came home, with my handkerchief tied round her neck.&nbsp; They knew
and understood, and the whole strength of the farm was turned out to
follow her, with wraps, and blankets, and brandy, and every thing that
could be thought of.&nbsp; I lay in chilly sleep, but still alive, beneath
the rock that Lassie guided them to.&nbsp; I was covered over with my
brother&rsquo;s plaid, and his thick shepherd&rsquo;s coat was carefully
wrapped round my feet.&nbsp; He was in his shirt-sleeves&mdash;his arm
thrown over me&mdash;a quiet smile (he had hardly ever smiled in life)
upon his still, cold face.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My father&rsquo;s last words were, &ldquo;God forgive me my hardness
of heart towards the fatherless child!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And what marked the depth of his feeling of repentance, perhaps more
than all, considering the passionate love he bore my mother, was this:
we found a paper of directions after his death, in which he desired
that he might lie at the foot of the grave, in which, by his desire,
poor Gregory had been laid with OUR MOTHER.</p>

one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:
http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
